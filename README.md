# Arcade Frontend Exercise

This project is a pair programming exercise designed to help demonstrate:

  - An understanding of modern React best practices
  - Writing testable code
  - The ability to work with other developers

## The Goals

The app is simple: a list of people with a search box.

As a user, I can search for a person's name and the list will filter down to only show people that match my search input.

The feature is sitting under [src/components/PeopleList](src/components/PeopleList), and the `Person` interface has these properties:

```ts
// src/types.ts

export interface Person {
  id: string;
  imageUrl?: string;
  name: string;
  teamName?: string;
}
```

The goals are to:
  - [ ] extend the search function to support filtering by `teamName`
  - [ ] identify (and fix) any potential performance issues
  - [ ] have no errors in the console
